Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality softwarre systems.
- Some importances of sofware engineering include: designing apps and systems that users find useful in their day to day lives, writing code that would make systems perform various tasks efficiently etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C) - Programming languages began to be created which made it easier to interact with computers.
  2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s - It began to be taught in universities as a course and research ensued.
  3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s - Well defined modules and control structures to execute instructions sequentially arose.
  4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s - The Agile methodology is a project management and software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements, design and implementation flowing downwards. In a Waterfall process, you must complete each project phase before moving to the next. It's pretty rigid and linear. Waterfall doesn't allow flexibility.
- Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. Agile process allows for cross-functional work across multiple phases of a project.
Waterfall would be appropriate in designs that require linear approach i.e in construction. Agile would be appropriate where multi-tasking is necessary to maximize efficiency i.e social media apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code eg. Visual Studio, Eclipse.
 - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Lack of collaborating effectively in software engineering teams. This can be solved through effective communication and collaboration with team members and stakeholders. By fostering an environment of open communication, software engineers can identify and address potential roadblocks or delays early on.
2. Scope creep and changing requirements. Scope creep refers to the gradual expansion of project requirements beyond the original plan.It often occurs due to unclear project goals, stakeholder and user changes or lack of proper documentation. To address these challenges, software engineers must establish a clear and transparent change management process. This involves documenting and communicating requirements changes, assessing their impact on the project timeline and budget, and obtaining the necessary approvals before implementing them. Regularly reviewing and updating project documentation, such as the project scope and requirements, can also help manage scope creep. By maintaining a clear understanding of the projectâ€™s boundaries, software engineers can effectively manage changes while minimizing disruption. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. This can help to find faults in the individual components and rectify them before integrating them with other components.
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. This can help one to realise if the individual modules are able to work efficiently with other modules.
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. This helps one to see if the required performance of the software has been met and is functional.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This helps to check if the users are satisfied with the software and also recognise user needs that need modification.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
- Prompt engineering is used in many real-world applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation tools. It helps improve the interaction between humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt: How to cook
- Improved prompt: How to cook a kenyan recipe of matoke
  The improved prompt is more effective as it offers more details about the enquiry and helps the AI model better understand what the user intended to ask therefore helps the AI model give an appropriate answer.
